# <Horiseon refactoring>

## Description

As requested in the challenge assignment, I have completed refactoring code to make the provided webpage more accessible to a wider audience and to move it inline with semantic coding principles. 
I have furthered my knowledge on this subject and will be able to use it daily going forward to ensure code I write is up to industry standards.

## Installation

NA - the webpage is already deployed.

## Usage

The web page is deployed and ready to be expanded up or retained as is.
It's functionality has been left intact but the HTML and CSS have been cleaned and made more readable for both SEO and future developers who may have to revisit this webpage.
